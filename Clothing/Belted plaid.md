# Belted plaid
## Introduction
![[Cameron+McIan+Original-530x760.jpg|250]]
The belted plaid is typically a 3,5m-4,5m long and 150cm wide piece of cloth. It can be worn all year when made out of [[Wool]].  I've tried making one out of thick cotton and it doesn't drape as nicely so I would usually recommend using [[Wool]].
## Experience
### Netherlands
- Rain:  3/5
	- Stays dry as rain pearls off in light rain (Very comfy)
	- Becomes damp in medium rain. (Not too unpleasant)
	- Soaked in heavy rain. (Stays warm, just slightly unpleasant)
- Cold: 5/5
	- Depending on the thickness of the wool wind can pass through more or less easily.
	- Warm enough during most days.
	- Keeps warm even when wet.
- Mist: 5/5
	- No effect on the wool
- Heat: 2/5
	- Protects from the sun but a bit too warm to keep on the shoulders in the Spring/Summer.
- Ideal Season: Fall/Winter/Early Spring
