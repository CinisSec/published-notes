# Eww bar
Link to the project -> [Eww Github page](https://github.com/elkowar/eww)
## Introduction
It's the bar software I use in conjunction with [[Hyprland]]. The config and scripts can be found in .config/eww/. In the past I've only used [[Wayland]] to run eww.

At first I used [[NixOS]] to run eww & hyprland but after a pathetic comeback to NixOS I've decided to switch to [[OpenSuse]] Tumbleweed. The transition was pretty painless. Aside from the undocumented dependencies.
## Undocumented dependencies
These are the packages I had to install on openSUSE to make it work.
- [[SysOps/Git Cheatsheet|git]]
- rustup
- gtk2-devel
- gtk3-devel
- gtk-layer-shell-devel
