## Gamedev
I've been playing around with the [[Playdate]] [[SDK]], mostly getting familiar with how to load in images and moving them around. I've done mot of it in Panic's [[Nova IDE]]. I'm not totally convinced by the IDE but it seems to be working well with playdate dev. I also made a background for the tama/digimon game.

Later I also loaded this background in my playdate project using [[Lua]].

It isn't much but I'm pretty proud.
I'm also thinking about not using any text only icons and gauges so that everyone can enjoy the experience without language barrier.
